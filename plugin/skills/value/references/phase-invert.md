# Phase 4: Inversion

This phase is the strategy layer's unique contribution. No delegation — always self-contained. Analysis plugins tell you what IS. Inversion asks what COULD GO WRONG.

Munger's insight: "Invert, always invert." Instead of asking "why should I buy this?" ask "why should I NOT buy this?" The best investors spend more time thinking about what can go wrong than what can go right.

## Always Self-Contained

This phase never delegates to analysis plugins. It synthesizes all prior phases and applies independent critical thinking. Use insights from Phases 1-3 as inputs, but the reasoning is original.

## Step 1: Identify Key Assumptions

List 3-5 assumptions that underpin the investment thesis from Phases 1-3:

For each assumption:
- **State it clearly** — "Revenue will grow at 8-12% for 5 years"
- **Evidence for** — what supports this assumption?
- **Evidence against** — what challenges this assumption?
- **Stress test** — what happens to the thesis if this assumption is wrong?
- **Probability of being wrong** — your honest estimate

Example assumptions to test:
- Revenue growth rate sustainability
- Margin stability or expansion
- Competitive moat durability
- Management quality and capital allocation
- Regulatory/macro environment stability

## Step 2: Pre-Mortem

> "It's 3 years from now. You invested and lost 50% of your money. What happened?"

Write 3 specific, realistic scenarios that would cause a 50% loss. Don't use generic risks — make them specific to this company:

- **Scenario A:** [specific competitive/industry event]
- **Scenario B:** [specific operational/financial event]
- **Scenario C:** [specific macro/regulatory event]

For each scenario: How likely is this? (1-10 scale) How detectable in advance?

## Step 3: Market View vs Your View

Apply Marks' second-level thinking explicitly:

| Factor | Consensus View | Your View | Why Different? |
|--------|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| Growth | ... | ... | ... |
| Margins | ... | ... | ... |
| Competitive position | ... | ... | ... |
| Valuation | ... | ... | ... |

**Critical question:** Where exactly do you disagree with the market? If nowhere, you have no edge — the current price is probably fair.

## Step 4: Psychological Bias Check (Munger's Checklist)

Honestly assess whether any of these biases are affecting your analysis:

- **Anchoring** — Am I anchoring on a previous price, a target, or someone else's opinion?
- **Confirmation bias** — Am I seeking information that confirms my thesis and ignoring contradictions?
- **Narrative fallacy** — Am I constructing a compelling story that makes me feel confident without sufficient evidence?
- **Sunk cost** — Am I committed because I've already spent time analyzing this?
- **Authority bias** — Am I influenced because a famous investor owns this?
- **Herding** — Am I interested because others are interested?
- **Recency bias** — Am I extrapolating recent performance into the future?
- **Endowment effect** — If I already own this, am I evaluating objectively?

For each bias that might apply: acknowledge it and state how you're correcting for it.

## Step 5: Define Kill Conditions

Kill conditions are specific, measurable events that would invalidate the thesis. They must be:
- **Specific** — not "business deteriorates" but "ROIC drops below 10% for 2 consecutive quarters"
- **Measurable** — you can observe whether they happened
- **Pre-committed** — defined before the investment, not rationalized after

Define at minimum 3 kill conditions:

1. **Financial kill condition** — e.g., "FCF turns negative for 2+ quarters"
2. **Competitive kill condition** — e.g., "Market share drops below X%"
3. **Thesis kill condition** — e.g., "Key assumption proven wrong by [specific event]"

## Step 6: Risk Hierarchy

Rank risks by category (most serious first):

1. **Permanent capital loss** — risk of losing money you never get back (bankruptcy, fraud, structural decline)
2. **Thesis impairment** — risk that your investment thesis is wrong (competitive disruption, market shift)
3. **Volatility** — risk of price swings that don't affect intrinsic value (market sentiment, macro)
4. **Opportunity cost** — risk that capital is better deployed elsewhere

Note: Marks teaches that risk is permanent loss, not volatility. A stock dropping 30% on sentiment is not the same as a business losing 30% of its value permanently.

## Phase 4 Output

Produce a summary with:
- **Source:** self-contained (always)
- Key assumptions (3-5) with stress test results
- Pre-mortem scenarios (3) with likelihood ratings
- Market view vs your view table
- Bias check acknowledgments
- Kill conditions (3+) — specific and measurable
- Risk hierarchy — permanent loss risks ranked
- **Phase 4 Score:** Strong / Adequate / Weak

**Note:** Phase 4 cannot be "Disqualifying" — it's a thinking exercise. But if this phase reveals that your thesis is built on shaky assumptions, or you have no genuine edge over the market, that should weigh heavily in Phase 5.
