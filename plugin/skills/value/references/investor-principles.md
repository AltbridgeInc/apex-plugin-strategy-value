# Investor Principles

These are not decorative quotes. Each principle maps to a specific analytical question that the strategy **must answer** in the verdict.

## Warren Buffett — Business Quality & Moat Durability

**Core frameworks:**
- Circle of competence — only invest in what you understand
- Moat durability — competitive advantage must be widening, not narrowing
- 10-year test — would you be comfortable owning this for a decade with no quotes?
- Owner mentality — think like a business owner, not a stock trader

**Required questions (Phase 1 + Phase 5):**
1. Can you explain this business and how it makes money in 2 sentences?
2. What is the moat? (brand, switching costs, network effects, cost advantage, regulatory)
3. Is the moat getting stronger or weaker? What evidence?
4. **Buffett's 10-Year Question:** If the stock market closed for 10 years, would you still buy this business at this price? Why?

## Charlie Munger — Inversion & Avoiding Stupidity

**Core frameworks:**
- Inversion — think about what to avoid, not what to seek
- Avoiding stupidity — more important than being brilliant
- Psychological bias awareness — know your own mental traps
- Multidisciplinary thinking — borrow models from other fields

**Required questions (Phase 4 + Phase 2):**
1. What's the dumbest thing I could do with this investment? (then don't do it)
2. What would make this business worth ZERO? Work backward from there
3. **Munger's Bias Checklist:** Am I anchoring on a prior price? Seeking confirming evidence? Falling for a narrative? Following the crowd?
4. What do I NOT understand about this business? (be honest)

## Benjamin Graham — Margin of Safety & Quantitative Discipline

**Core frameworks:**
- Margin of safety — buy significantly below intrinsic value
- Mr. Market — the market is a voting machine short-term, weighing machine long-term
- Quantitative screens — numbers don't lie (but they can be manipulated)
- Temperament over intellect — discipline matters more than brilliance

**Required questions (Phase 3 + Phase 5):**
1. What is the margin of safety? (specific percentage below intrinsic value)
2. What is Mr. Market offering today, and why? Is the price driven by fundamentals or sentiment?
3. What would Graham's quantitative screen say? (P/E below 15? P/B below 1.5? Debt/equity below 1?)
4. **Graham's Test:** Am I buying a dollar for 50 cents, or hoping to sell a dollar for two?

## Li Lu — Simplicity & Knowledge Compounding

**Core frameworks:**
- Simplicity test — if it takes more than 2 sentences, you don't understand it
- Knowledge compounding — invest where your understanding deepens over time
- Understanding depth — distinguish between knowing the name and knowing the thing
- Asian market insight — capacity to evaluate businesses across cultures

**Required questions (Phase 1 + Phase 5):**
1. **Li Lu's Simplicity Test:** Describe this business in one sentence. If you can't, stop.
2. Will your understanding of this business compound? Will you be smarter about it in 5 years?
3. Do you actually understand how this company makes money, or just the narrative?
4. Is this business simple enough that a normal person could run it well?

## Howard Marks — Second-Level Thinking & Risk

**Core frameworks:**
- Second-level thinking — "What does consensus think, and why is it wrong?"
- Risk as permanent capital loss — not volatility, not beta
- Cycle awareness — where are we in the cycle?
- The most important thing — risk control, not risk avoidance

**Required questions (Phase 4 + Phase 3):**
1. **Marks' Second-Level Question:** What is the consensus view on this stock? What am I seeing that others aren't?
2. What is the probability of permanent capital loss (not temporary drawdown)?
3. Where are we in the business/market/credit cycle? How does that affect this investment?
4. Am I being compensated for the risks I'm taking? (risk-adjusted return, not just return)

## Seth Klarman — Discipline to Pass & Downside First

**Core frameworks:**
- Discipline to pass — most opportunities aren't worth taking
- Downside first — always ask "what can I lose?" before "what can I gain?"
- Catalyst awareness — why will value be recognized? What unlocks value?
- Margin of safety as religion — not just a concept, a requirement

**Required questions (Phase 5 + Phase 4):**
1. **Klarman's Discipline:** Is this genuinely one of the best opportunities available, or am I just filling a position?
2. What is the downside scenario? How much could I lose, and can I afford it?
3. What catalyst will cause the market to recognize the value? When?
4. If I'm wrong, how wrong can I be? (asymmetry of outcomes)

## Principle Application Map

| Phase | Primary Principles | Required Answers |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Phase 1: Understand** | Buffett (moat, circle of competence), Li Lu (simplicity, depth) | Moat type, 10Y durability, simplicity test |
| **Phase 2: Verify** | Munger (avoid stupidity, bias), Graham (quantitative discipline) | Red flag check, what you don't know |
| **Phase 3: Value** | Graham (margin of safety, Mr. Market), Marks (risk, second-level) | Fair value range, margin %, cycle position |
| **Phase 4: Invert** | Munger (inversion, bias checklist), Marks (second-level), Klarman (downside) | Pre-mortem, bias check, downside quantification |
| **Phase 5: Verdict** | Buffett (10Y test), Li Lu (compounding), Klarman (discipline to pass) | Buy/Wait/Pass with conviction, kill conditions |
